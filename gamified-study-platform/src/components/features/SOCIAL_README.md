- Participant status tracking
- Study session controls
- Room settings display
- Active session statistics

## Data Flow

### State Management
The social features use Zustand for state management through `socialStore.ts`:

```typescript
// Key state properties
interface SocialState {
  groups: StudyGroup[];
  activeGroup: StudyGroup | null;
  challenges: GroupChallenge[];
  studyRooms: StudyRoom[];
  messages: GroupMessage[];
  leaderboards: GroupLeaderboard[];
  // ... other properties
}
```

### Service Layer
`studyGroupService.ts` handles all API interactions:
- Group CRUD operations
- Member management
- Challenge operations
- Study room management
- Message handling
- Leaderboard calculations

### Custom Hook
`useSocial.ts` provides a convenient interface to the social store:
```typescript
const {
  groups,
  activeGroup,
  createGroup,
  joinGroup,
  sendMessage,
  // ... other methods
} = useSocial();
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `study_groups` - Group information
- `group_memberships` - User-group relationships
- `group_messages` - Chat messages
- `group_challenges` - Group challenges
- `challenge_participants` - Challenge participation
- `study_rooms` - Virtual study rooms
- `study_room_participants` - Room participation
- `group_activities` - Activity logging
- `group_leaderboards` - Cached leaderboard data

### Security
All tables implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure:
- Users can only access groups they belong to
- Proper role-based permissions for admin actions
- Secure message and activity access

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Study Group
```typescript
const { createGroup } = useSocial();

const handleCreateGroup = async () => {
  await createGroup({
    name: "Advanced Mathematics",
    description: "Group for calculus and linear algebra study",
    isPrivate: false,
    maxMembers: 20
  });
};
```

### Joining a Group
```typescript
const { joinGroup } = useSocial();

const handleJoinGroup = async () => {
  await joinGroup({
    inviteCode: "ABC123"
  });
};
```

### Sending Messages
```typescript
const { sendMessage } = useSocial();

const handleSendMessage = async (groupId: string, content: string) => {
  await sendMessage(groupId, content, 'text');
};
```

## Testing

The social features include comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for service layer functions
- Component testing for UI interactions
- Integration tests for data flow
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

Run tests with:
```bash
npm run test src/services/__tests__/studyGroupService.test.ts
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
2. **Caching**: Leaderboard data is cached to reduce database load
3. **Pagination**: Large lists are paginated for better performance
4. **Debouncing**: Search inputs are debounced to reduce API calls
5. **Memoization**: Expensive calculations are memoized

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connections for live chat
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Automatic reconnection handling

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- User permissions are enforced at the database level
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

### Privacy Controls
- Private groups require invitation to join
- Message history is only accessible to group members
- User activity data is anonymized in analytics
- GDPR compliance for data deletion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Groups not loading**
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Messages not sending**
   - Verify group membership
   - Check message content validation
   - Ensure proper error handling

3. **Leaderboard not updating**
   - Check cache invalidation
   - Verify calculation logic
   - Ensure proper data synchronization

### Debug Tools
- Browser developer tools for client-side debugging
- Database query logs for server-side issues
- Network tab for API request monitoring
- Console logs for application flow tracking

1. Follow the established component patterns
2. Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
3. Update this documentation for significant changes
4. Ensure accessibility compliance
5. Test across different screen sizes
6. Validate database migrations thoroughly
