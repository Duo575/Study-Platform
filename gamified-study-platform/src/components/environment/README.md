# Environment System Integration

This document describes the implementation of task 2.3: "Create basic Environment component" from the Focus Environments and Pet System specification.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. EnvironmentProvider Integration

- **Location**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Wraps the entire application to provide environment context
- **Features**:
  - Loads available environments on app startup
  - Applies CSS theme variables to document root
  - Provides environment context to all child components
  - Handles environment switching and state management

### 2. Environment Selector in Study Interface

- **Location**: `src/pages/PomodoroPage.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Allows users to select focus environments during study sessions
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown interface for environment selection
  - Preview functionality for environment themes
  - Integration with study context panel
  - Visual indicators for locked/unlocked environments

### 3. CSS Variable Injection

- **Implementation**: Automatic theme application via EnvironmentProvider
- **CSS Variables Applied**:
  - `--env-primary`: Primary theme color
  - `--env-secondary`: Secondary theme color
  - `--env-bg`: Background color
  - `--env-text`: Text color
  - `--env-accent`: Accent color
  - `--env-background-image`: Environment background image

## Components Structure

```
src/components/environment/
â”œâ”€â”€ EnvironmentProvider.tsx      # Context provider for environment state
â”œâ”€â”€ EnvironmentSelector.tsx      # UI component for environment selection
â”œâ”€â”€ EnvironmentIntegrationDemo.tsx # Demo component for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ MusicPlayer.tsx             # Music player component (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                    # Export barrel
â””â”€â”€ __tests__/
    â””â”€â”€ EnvironmentIntegration.test.tsx # Integration tests
```

## Integration Points

### App-Level Integration

```typescript
// src/App.tsx
<EnvironmentProvider>
  <Router>
    {/* All routes wrapped with environment context */}
  </Router>
</EnvironmentProvider>
```

### Study Interface Integration

```typescript
// src/pages/PomodoroPage.tsx
<Card className="p-6">
  <h3>ðŸŒŸ Focus Environment</h3>
  <EnvironmentSelector
    className="w-full"
    showPreview={true}
  />
</Card>
```

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Environment Provider Wrapper

- Wraps study interface with environment context
- Automatically loads and initializes environments
- Provides environment state to child components

### âœ… Environment Selection UI

- Dropdown interface with environment options
- Visual previews of environment themes
- Lock/unlock status indicators
- Premium environment badges

### âœ… CSS Variable Injection

- Automatic theme application on environment switch
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Background image application
- Smooth transitions between environments

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { EnvironmentProvider, EnvironmentSelector, useEnvironment } from './components/environment';

// Wrap your app with EnvironmentProvider
<EnvironmentProvider>
  <YourApp />
</EnvironmentProvider>

// Use EnvironmentSelector in study interfaces
<EnvironmentSelector
  className="w-full"
  showPreview={true}
/>

// Access environment state in components
const { currentEnvironment, switchEnvironment } = useEnvironment();
```

## Testing

### Integration Test

- Location: `src/components/environment/__tests__/EnvironmentIntegration.test.tsx`
- Tests provider functionality, CSS variable application, and component rendering

### Demo Component

- Location: `src/components/environment/EnvironmentIntegrationDemo.tsx`
- Visual demonstration of environment system integration
- Shows theme application and environment switching

## Requirements Satisfied

From the original task requirements:

1. âœ… **Build EnvironmentProvider component to wrap study interface**
   - Implemented in `App.tsx` wrapping all protected routes
   - Provides environment context and state management

2. âœ… **Implement environment switching UI with environment selection dropdown**
   - Added `EnvironmentSelector` to `PomodoroPage.tsx`
   - Dropdown interface with preview functionality
   - Visual indicators for environment status

3. âœ… **Add basic CSS variable injection for theme colors**
   - Automatic CSS variable application in `EnvironmentProvider`
   - Theme colors applied to document root
   - Background images and visual elements supported

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:

- Audio system integration (task 3.x)
- Advanced environment features
- Theme customization system
- Environment unlocking mechanics

The basic environment component system is now ready for use and further development.
