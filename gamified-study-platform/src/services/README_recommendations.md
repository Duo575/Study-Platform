## Algorithm Details

### Performance Analysis
The system analyzes multiple performance metrics:

- **Study Time Score**: Compares actual vs. estimated study time
- **Quest Completion Score**: Measures task completion rates
- **Consistency Score**: Evaluates study frequency and regularity
- **Deadline Adherence Score**: Tracks deadline compliance

### Pattern Recognition
Identifies user patterns through:

- **Peak Performance Hours**: Times when users are most productive
- **Session Length Optimization**: Ideal study session durations
- **Break Preferences**: Optimal break intervals
- **Productivity Trends**: Improving, stable, or declining performance

### Confidence Calculation
Recommendation confidence is based on:

- Amount of available data
- Consistency of patterns
- Recency of data
- Algorithm version and reliability

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { recommendationService } from '../services/recommendationService';

// Generate new recommendations
const recommendations = await recommendationService.generateRecommendations(userId);

// Get active recommendations with filters
const activeRecs = await recommendationService.getActiveRecommendations(userId, {
  type: 'study_schedule',
  priority: 'high'
});

// Apply a recommendation
await recommendationService.applyRecommendation(recommendationId);
```

### Using the React Hook

```typescript
import { useRecommendations } from '../hooks/useRecommendations';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    recommendations,
    isLoading,
    stats,
    actions
  } = useRecommendations({ userId: 'user-123' });

  const handleApply = async (id: string) => {
    await actions.applyRecommendation(id);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {recommendations.map(rec => (
        <RecommendationCard
          key={rec.id}
          recommendation={rec}
          onApply={handleApply}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
