- Recommends study techniques matching user preferences

### 4. Habit Formation
- Builds consistent study streaks (targets < 7 days)
- Establishes daily study routines
- Provides motivation and tracking strategies

### 5. Goal Adjustment
- Identifies unrealistic goal loads (>3 active goals with <60% performance)
- Suggests goal prioritization and simplification
- Recommends achievable milestone setting

### 6. Time Management
- Optimizes study schedules based on productivity patterns
- Suggests session length adjustments
- Provides break and rest recommendations

## ðŸ§  AI Integration

### Performance Analysis Integration
- Leverages existing `performanceAnalysisService` for subject performance data
- Integrates with `aiService` for enhanced recommendation generation
- Uses machine learning patterns for personalization

### Confidence Calculation
```typescript
confidence = (dataPoints/20) * (consistencyScore/100) * (timeSpanFactor)
```
- Based on data availability, consistency, and recency
- Ranges from 0.1 to 0.95 for reliability

### Prioritization Algorithm
- **Impact Weight**: 40% (high/medium/low impact estimation)
- **Feasibility Weight**: 30% (implementation difficulty)
- **Urgency Weight**: 20% (critical/high/medium/low priority)
- **Confidence Weight**: 10% (algorithm confidence)
