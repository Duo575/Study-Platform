# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The gamified study platform is experiencing a critical performance issue where clicking on todo items causes the entire web application to freeze and Vite to become unresponsive. This issue prevents users from interacting with the todo functionality, which is a core feature of the platform. The problem appears to be related to infinite loops, memory leaks, or blocking operations in the todo toggle functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to click on todo checkboxes to toggle their completion status without the application freezing, so that I can efficiently manage my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a todo checkbox THEN the todo completion status SHALL toggle immediately without any application freeze
2. WHEN a todo is toggled THEN the XP animation SHALL display smoothly without blocking the UI thread
3. WHEN multiple todos are toggled in quick succession THEN the application SHALL remain responsive
4. WHEN a todo is toggled THEN the operation SHALL complete within 500ms maximum

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the todo list to remain performant even with many todos, so that I can manage large task lists efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the todo list contains up to 100 todos THEN all interactions SHALL remain responsive
2. WHEN filtering or searching todos THEN the results SHALL update within 200ms
3. WHEN the todo store updates THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
4. WHEN todos are loaded THEN the initial render SHALL complete within 1 second

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix the root cause of the performance issue, so that the application remains stable and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating the performance issue THEN all potential infinite loops SHALL be identified and resolved
2. WHEN examining the todo toggle functionality THEN all async operations SHALL be properly handled
3. WHEN reviewing component re-renders THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be eliminated
4. WHEN testing the fix THEN the application SHALL remain responsive under normal and stress conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want error handling for todo operations, so that failed operations don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a todo operation fails THEN the error SHALL be caught and displayed to the user
2. WHEN an async operation times out THEN the loading state SHALL be cleared
3. WHEN the mock database service fails THEN the application SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN appropriate fallback behavior SHALL be implemented
