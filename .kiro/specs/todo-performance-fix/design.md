# Design Document

## Overview

The todo performance issue appears to be caused by a combination of factors including potential infinite loops in the todo toggle functionality, improper async handling, and excessive component re-renders. This design outlines a systematic approach to diagnose and fix these performance bottlenecks.

## Architecture

### Current Problem Analysis

Based on the symptoms (application freeze when clicking todos), the likely causes are:

1. **Infinite Loop in State Updates**: The todo toggle might be causing cascading state updates
2. **Blocking Async Operations**: Long-running or failed async operations blocking the UI thread
3. **Excessive Re-renders**: Components re-rendering unnecessarily due to state changes
4. **Memory Leaks**: Event listeners or timers not being cleaned up properly
5. **Mock Service Issues**: The mock database service might have blocking operations

### Root Cause Investigation Strategy

1. **Console Logging**: Add strategic console logs to trace execution flow
2. **Performance Profiling**: Use React DevTools and browser profiler
3. **Error Boundary**: Implement error boundaries to catch and isolate errors
4. **Async Operation Timeout**: Add timeouts to prevent hanging operations
5. **State Update Batching**: Ensure state updates are properly batched

## Components and Interfaces

### Performance Monitoring Component

```typescript
interface PerformanceMonitor {
  startTimer(operation: string): void;
  endTimer(operation: string): void;
  logPerformanceMetrics(): void;
}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

```typescript
interface TodoErrorBoundary {
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo): void;
  render(): ReactNode;
}
```

### Optimized Todo Store

```typescript
interface OptimizedTodoStore {
  // Debounced operations
  debouncedToggleTodo: (id: string) => Promise<void>;

  // Batch operations
  batchUpdateTodos: (updates: TodoUpdate[]) => Promise<void>;

  // Performance metrics
  getPerformanceMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

## Data Models

### Performance Metrics

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  averageToggleTime: number;
  totalOperations: number;
  failedOperations: number;
  lastOperationTime: number;
}
```

### Todo Operation Result

```typescript
interface TodoOperationResult {
  success: boolean;
  todo?: Todo;
  xpEarned: number;
  error?: string;
  executionTime: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Timeout Implementation

- All async operations will have a 5-second timeout
- Failed operations will be logged and gracefully handled
- Loading states will be properly cleared on timeout

### Error Boundaries

- Wrap todo components in error boundaries
- Provide fallback UI for failed components
- Log errors for debugging without crashing the app

### Retry Logic

- Implement exponential backoff for failed operations
- Maximum 3 retry attempts for network operations
- Circuit breaker pattern for consistently failing operations

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Test with 100+ todos to ensure scalability
2. **Stress Testing**: Rapid clicking on multiple todos
3. **Memory Testing**: Monitor for memory leaks during extended use
4. **Async Testing**: Test timeout and error scenarios

### Unit Testing

1. **Todo Store**: Test all store operations in isolation
2. **Component Testing**: Test todo components with mocked store
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and recovery
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance metrics

### Integration Testing

1. **End-to-End**: Test complete todo workflows
2. **Cross-Browser**: Ensure performance across different browsers
3. **Device Testing**: Test on different device capabilities
4. **Network Conditions**: Test under various network conditions

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes

1. Add comprehensive error handling to todo operations
2. Implement operation timeouts to prevent hanging
3. Add performance logging to identify bottlenecks
4. Fix any obvious infinite loops or blocking operations

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization

1. Implement debouncing for rapid operations
2. Optimize component re-rendering with React.memo and useMemo
3. Add batch operations for multiple todo updates
4. Implement virtual scrolling for large todo lists

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Add performance monitoring dashboard
2. Implement automated performance regression testing
3. Set up alerting for performance degradation
4. Create performance optimization guidelines

## Technical Decisions

### Debouncing Strategy

- Use 300ms debounce for todo toggle operations
- Prevent multiple simultaneous operations on the same todo
- Queue operations if needed rather than dropping them

### State Management Optimization

- Use React.memo for TodoListItem components
- Implement proper dependency arrays for useEffect hooks
- Batch state updates using React's automatic batching

### Error Recovery

- Implement optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Provide clear user feedback for failed operations
- Maintain application state consistency even during errors
