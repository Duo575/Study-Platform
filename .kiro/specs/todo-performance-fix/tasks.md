# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add comprehensive error handling and logging to todo operations

  - Add try-catch blocks around all async operations in todo store
  - Implement console logging to trace execution flow during todo toggle
  - Add performance timing logs to measure operation duration
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Implement operation timeouts to prevent hanging operations

  - Add 5-second timeout to all async operations in todo store
  - Clear loading states when operations timeout
  - Provide user feedback for timed-out operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Fix infinite loop issues in todo toggle functionality



  - Review and fix the toggleTodo function implementation
  - Ensure proper async/await handling without blocking operations
  - Prevent cascading state updates that could cause infinite loops
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 1.1, 1.2_



- [ ] 4. Optimize component re-rendering with React performance techniques

  - Wrap TodoListItem component with React.memo
  - Add proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks


  - Implement useMemo for expensive calculations in todo components
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 5. Add debouncing to prevent rapid successive operations



  - Implement 300ms debounce for todo toggle operations
  - Prevent multiple simultaneous operations on the same todo
  - Add operation queuing if needed for rapid clicks
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 1.1_



- [ ] 6. Implement error boundaries for todo components

  - Create TodoErrorBoundary component to catch and handle errors
  - Wrap todo list and todo items in error boundaries
  - Provide fallback UI for failed components
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 3.3_




- [ ] 7. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

  - Create performance monitoring utilities
  - Track operation timing and success rates
  - Log performance metrics for debugging
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 2.4, 1.4_

-

- [-] 8. Test and validate the performance fixes

  - Test todo toggle operations under normal conditions
  - Perform stress testing with rapid clicking
  - Verify application remains responsive with large todo lists
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1_
