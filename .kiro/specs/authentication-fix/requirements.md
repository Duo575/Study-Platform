# Authentication System Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The current authentication system is experiencing connection issues with Supabase, preventing users from signing in. This spec addresses the need to create a robust authentication system that works reliably, with proper fallback mechanisms and debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Authentication Connection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign in to the application reliably, so that I can access my study dashboard and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them successfully
2. WHEN the Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message to the user
3. WHEN there are connection issues THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. IF the primary authentication service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to a local authentication method for development

### Requirement 2: Authentication Debugging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to debug authentication issues quickly, so that I can resolve user sign-in problems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide a debug panel with authentication diagnostics
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to create test users and validate connections
4. IF Supabase configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL display specific configuration errors

### Requirement 3: Fallback Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access the application even when the primary authentication service is down, so that I can continue using the study platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to a mock authentication service
2. WHEN using fallback authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain user session state locally
3. WHEN the primary service is restored THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition back to Supabase
4. IF using fallback mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the user

### Requirement 4: User Account Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to create an account and manage my profile, so that I can personalize my study experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create their account with proper validation
2. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL initialize their profile and game statistics
4. IF a user already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate account creation

### Requirement 5: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN the system SHALL persist their session
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to sign in again
4. IF a user signs out THEN the system SHALL completely clear their session data

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when authentication fails, so that I know how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid email or password"
2. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display "Connection problem. Please try again."
3. WHEN authentication fails due to server issues THEN the system SHALL display "Service temporarily unavailable"
4. IF authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their dashboard immediately
