# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The gamified study platform has multiple bugs, missing connections, and incomplete implementations throughout the entire codebase.

3. WHEN services are called THEN all service connections SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN stores are accessed THEN all state management SHALL be properly connected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all gamification and social features to be fully connected and functional, so that I can enjoy the complete study experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes study activities THEN gamification features SHALL update correctly
2. WHEN a user accesses social features THEN they SHALL be fully implemented and connected
3. WHEN a user uses AI features THEN they SHALL be properly integrated with the rest of the app
4. WHEN a user exports data THEN all export features SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want all responsive and accessibility features to work properly, so that I can use the application on any device with any accessibility needs.
